GLaDOS is a modified version of [tgpt](https://github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt), made to give the AI some instructions at the start of a new chat and extend the functionality of the original [tgpt](https://github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt) program, GLaDOS runs on the terminal, and needs bash to function and it only works on linux!

GLaDOS doesn't need API keys to work, as the AI that it contacts is [BAI Chat](https://chatbot.theb.ai), a free AI tool
